{"name":"nush","tagline":"A traditional roguelike","body":"### About\r\n_nush_ is a traditional, coffeebreak roguelike set in a lightweight science-fiction universe. You play a treasure hunter who has landed on a former human colony, home to an important research base. Your purpose is to delve the complex and find the _Core of Nushangthmpfz_, a powerful artifact which is said to be an infinite energy source.\r\n\r\n### State of the game\r\nThe game is in development, so any contributions are highly appreciated. Be sure to send in any bugs you may encounter, and also any suggestions you may have!\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nBeing in an early development stage, the game has no downloadable binaries. To build the game yourself, you'll need a C compiler, a flavour of `curses` (both `ncurses` and `pdcurses` are supported), and a flavour of Lua. Currently supported Lua versions are `5.1` up to `5.3`, and `LuaJIT 2.0.4`.\r\n\r\nCurrently supported operating systems (on which the game has been tested) are 64-bit Linux and 32-bit Windows.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nThe roguelike is licensed under the terms and conditions of the Simplified BSD License, so you're free to fork the project on GitHub if you'd like to lend a hand.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
