High Priority:
	* actor stats
	* enemy AI
	* winning condition and endgame
	* symmetric field of view
	* traps - when enemies are alerted, but have no path towards the player,
	  they seem to move randomly (?)

Low Priority:
	* sort high score list
	* concatenate messages within the same turn into one big message
	* grammar engine for (or at least fixup verbs in) messages
	* diversify loot
	* tools/augments, e.g. to detect lifeforms through walls
	* AI with different intelligence - for example, humanoid enemies may open doors
	* tile cost for dijkstra maps should be calculated using a terrainType attr rather
	  than .solid, and customisable for different for different actor/AI types
	* when calculating fleemaps, the cost of stepping onto a tile near the player
	  should be much higher than normal (requires duplicating Tiles?)
	* enemies should be able to swap places; currently fleeing and approaching enemies
	  in a hallway get stuck
