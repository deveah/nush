High Priority:
	* actor stats
	* enemy AI
	* winning condition and endgame
	* symmetric field of view
	* traps - when enemies are alerted, but have no path towards the player,
	  they seem to move randomly (?)

Low Priority:
	* concatenate messages within the same turn into one big message
	* diversify loot
	* fixed dungeon structure?
	* AI with different intelligence - for example, humanoid enemies may open doors
