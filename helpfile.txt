`5' or `.' waits for a turn, or targets self when targetting.

Press `/' and then a direction, or `shift' plus a vi key (`YKUHLBJN'), to move in
a straight line until you reach a wall or something interesting such as an
item or enemy.

Move onto an enemy to perform a melee attack, or onto a closed door
to open it. Opening a locked door requires a matching key.
